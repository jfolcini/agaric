//! #1280 — the advanced-query engine: a composable boolean-tree query over
//! all structural filter dimensions, compiled via the shared
//! [`crate::filters`] vocabulary and returned as a cursor-paginated page of
//! blocks.
//!
//! This is the **first end-to-end** advanced query: it takes a
//! [`FilterExpr`] boolean tree (AND / OR / NOT across every shared +
//! metadata leaf), compiles it through [`projection::QueryProjection`]
//! (which delegates each leaf to [`crate::filters::PagesProjection`] so the
//! SQL is byte-shape-identical to the Pages surface), and runs a keyset-
//! paginated `SELECT … FROM blocks b`.
//!
//! ## Scope (structural + full-text)
//!
//! The C1 engine was structural-only; later fast-follows added **full-text
//! composition**, **grouping**, and now **aggregation** (C4) — global
//! `count` / `sum` / `avg` / `min` / `max` over the full match set and, when
//! `group_by` is set, per-group. The wire shapes reserve forward-compat slots
//! so further extensions stay non-breaking:
//!
//! * [`QueryResultRow::score`] — the ranking channel. `Some(bm25)` when the
//!   request carried a `fulltext` term; `None` for purely structural
//!   queries. A future vector pass may also fill it.
//! * [`SortSource`] — a tagged enum with `Column` and `Relevance` variants.
//!   `Aggregate` / `VectorScore` are reserved for the aggregate / vector
//!   PRs and are intentionally NOT added yet (there is no aggregate or
//!   vector channel to sort on).
//! * [`AdvancedQueryRequest`] carries `fulltext`, `group_by`, AND now
//!   `aggregates`. When `group_by` is `Some`, the response's `groups` field
//!   carries per-bucket counts + a bounded member preview and `rows` is
//!   empty; when `None`, the engine is byte-for-byte the flat C1+FTS engine
//!   (`groups` empty). Requested `aggregates` are computed GLOBALLY (over the
//!   full match set, on the first page only) into
//!   [`AdvancedQueryResponse::aggregates`] and — when grouping — PER-GROUP into
//!   each [`QueryGroup::aggregates`].
//!
//! ## Grouping (this fast-follow)
//!
//! A [`GroupSpec`] picks ONE dimension ([`GroupKey`]) to bucket the matched
//! rows by — tag, page, state, block-type, priority, a typed property, or a
//! date bucket. The engine runs a `GROUP BY <key-expr>` over the SAME
//! predicate as the flat path (structural + optional FTS `MATCH`), returns
//! the buckets ordered by descending count (then key) with group-level
//! keyset pagination, and attaches a bounded per-group member PREVIEW (the
//! first N members in the default sort, via a `ROW_NUMBER()` window) so a
//! huge bucket cannot blow the payload. The full member list of one bucket
//! is a follow-up "expand group" flat query scoped to that key.
//!
//! **Tag multiplicity (documented):** grouping by [`GroupKey::Tag`] joins
//! `block_tags`, so a block with K tags appears in K tag groups and is
//! counted once per group. Every other key is single-valued (one bucket per
//! block).
