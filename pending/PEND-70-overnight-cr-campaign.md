# PEND-70 — Overnight code-review campaign (2026-05-24)

**Goal:** run code-review rounds **non-stop until 08:00 CEST (2026-05-24)**,
identifying and fixing correctness bugs, robustness gaps, perf issues, a11y
defects, security exposure, weak typing, missing tests, and doc drift across the
`pend-58f-search-view-hardening` branch — which is now merged up to `origin/main`
and carries: PEND-58g search-view hardening (8 batches), PEND-69 toolchain
hygiene, the session-log archival, and (via the merge) PEND-58 pages compound
filters.

**End deliverable:** a PR against `main` with CI passing, ready to merge & release.

## Operating mode (the loop)

Each **round**:

1. Re-read this file (it is the running ledger; never cache it).
2. If a review subagent just completed, **triage** its findings:
   - **Fix now** — high-confidence correctness / security / a11y / perf bugs and
     clear improvements. Make the smallest change; behaviour-preserving unless the
     finding *is* a behaviour bug.
   - **Defer + log** — uncertain, large-refactor, or design-decision findings:
     record in the ledger with rationale; do NOT risk a speculative fix overnight.
   - **Reject + log** — false positives (note why, so they aren't re-raised).
3. **Verify** every fix: `npx tsc -b --noEmit`, `biome check` on changed files,
   the affected `vitest`/`nextest`/`clippy` targets. Run `prek` before each commit.
4. **Commit** (small, focused, green) and **push** so CI re-validates.
5. **Append** a ledger row.
6. Launch the **next** round's review subagent (background) on the next focus
   slice, and set a `ScheduleWakeup` fallback. The loop is driven by
   background-subagent completions; the wakeup is the safety net.

**Stop at 08:00 CEST** → final `prek run --all-files`, push, ensure the PR's CI is
green, leave it ready to merge. Then end the loop (no further wakeup).

**Guardrails:** every commit must pass `prek`. Never push red. Don't churn
already-justified suppressions (see PEND-69). Don't auto-apply risky refactors
(e.g. the deferred `noExcessiveCognitiveComplexity` extraction) unattended —
log them. Keep reverts surgical.

## Focus rotation (areas; revisit as needed)

1. **noBannedTypes** — 38 `as Function` casts → precise fn types (6 editor test
   files). *(prelim quick-win)*
2. **Search DSL** — `to-search-filter`, `autocomplete`, `fold-for-search`,
   `glob-validate`, `serialize`, `tokenize`: caret math, NFC, projection contract.
3. **Search frontend** — `SearchPanel` + extracted hooks (`useSearchResults`,
   `useSearchHistoryControls`), `FilterHelperPopover`, results virtualization,
   combobox/listbox a11y, focus management.
4. **Merge integration** — compound filters (main) × search (mine): shared
   `FilterPrimitive`/`Projection`, `bindings.ts`/IPC shape consistency, no
   duplicated/diverged filter logic.
5. **Pagination** — `has_more`/cursor/over-fetch contracts (backend `queries.rs`,
   `usePaginatedQuery`).
6. **Security** — XSS (mermaid/QR/innerHTML), SQL/FTS injection, glob/path
   traversal, secret leakage, the merged GitHub workflows.
7. **Perf** — effect-dep correctness, re-render hotspots, virtualization windows,
   N+1 IPC, the detached partitioned-scan connection hold (BE-A5).
8. **Error handling / edge cases** — empty states, long values, truncation, RTL,
   mobile viewport, abort/cancel races.
9. **Test coverage** — unit + e2e gaps for changed code paths.
10. **Docs** — PEND docs, FEATURE-MAP, AGENTS, SESSION-LOG accuracy.
11. **Rust** — clippy spot-checks, error paths, sqlx cache, migration safety.

## Pre-campaign state (baseline)

- HEAD `eb4f96b1` (merge of `origin/main` into the branch); 0 behind / 65 ahead
  of `origin/main`; tree clean.
- `prek run --all-files` green on the merged tree (Session 828 verification).
- Open: noBannedTypes fix; push + open PR; CI verification.

Verified: boot replay is delta-only (not full-scan), search SQL bounded everywhere (no missing-index scans), frontend well-memoized (single batched breadcrumb resolve, virtualized window, correct abort). 2 MINOR: exit-save `block_on` has no timeout; periodic snapshot holds the registry mutex across all-space export | logged both (timeout needs a *measured* value; mutex-hold is a deliberate documented trade-off) | no code change |
| 8 | 03:35 | error-handling + adversarial edge cases | subagent: **no CRITICAL**. 1 MAJOR: `PropFilterForm` silently corrupts the search when key/value has `=`/space/`"` (verbatim serialize → first-`=`/whitespace re-parse) — NEW surface from Batch 5. 2 MINOR: `withAbort` unhandled-rejection on a pre-aborted signal; breadcrumb non-array result silently un-logged. Verified graceful: regex/glob caps, usePaginatedQuery abort/error, empty/boundary states, StrictMode pendingViewQuery one-shot, persisted-state coercion | **fixed** MAJOR (PropFilterForm key/value validation + inline a11y error + 2 i18n keys + 6-test file) + both MINOR (withAbort no-op catch; breadcrumb non-array warn); tsc + 122 vitest green | `CR8` |

## Deferred findings (for human review — not auto-fixed overnight)

These are real but either design-level, on load-bearing/pre-existing paths, or
codebase-wide patterns — applying speculative unattended fixes risks regressing
tested behavior. Captured here for a maintainer decision / a follow-up PR.

- **[a11y, MAJOR] Cross-group keyboard roving loses the SR active-descendant**
  (`SearchResultGroups.tsx` / `VirtualizedResultListbox.tsx`). Per-group
  `role="listbox"` is the documented PEND-50 design; only the owning group sets
  `aria-activedescendant`, but DOM focus doesn't move to the new group when
  arrowing across a boundary, so multi-group results don't announce the active
  row to screen readers. Fix needs programmatic `.focus()` on group change (or a
  single spanning listbox) + a11y testing — a design change, not a quick fix.
- **[a11y, MINOR] History-recall `activeIndex`→`aria-activedescendant` is dead**
  (`SearchPanel.tsx`). The history dropdown unmounts once recall fills the input
  (query becomes non-empty), so the `activeIndex` wiring is never perceivable.
  Either keep the dropdown mounted during `cycling.activeIndex >= 0` (UX change)
  or drop the unreachable wiring.
- **[perf, MINOR] Breadcrumb `batchResolve` re-fires for unresolvable page_ids**
  (`useSearchResults.ts`). Soft-deleted/missing parents are never cached, so they
  re-fetch on every `loadMore`. Bounded waste. Fix: track attempted ids (a ref)
  so they're not retried — touches the load-bearing breadcrumb effect, so defer.
- **[correctness, MINOR] Breadcrumb resolution not space-scoped**
  (`useSearchResults.ts`): `batchResolve(parentIds)` omits `currentSpaceId` →
  global scope (lifted verbatim from the pre-extraction code; correct today
  because results are already space-scoped server-side).
- **[a11y, MINOR] `IncludeExcludeToggle` radiogroup + `SearchToggleRow` toolbar**
  lack roving tabindex / arrow-key nav — but this matches the existing
  `QueryBuilderModal` convention, so it's a codebase-wide a11y pattern, not a
  branch regression.
- **[lifecycle, MINOR] Vestigial `SnapshotTaskShutdown` flag** (`lib.rs` /
  `loro/snapshot.rs`): stored via `app.manage(...)` but never set to `true`, so
  the periodic snapshot task only ends at process exit; clean-exit persistence is
  handled separately by the `RunEvent::Exit` handler, so it's harmless dead
  plumbing. Either wire a shutdown caller or drop the managed flag. Not changed
  overnight — it's on the app-lifecycle path (risky to rewire unattended).
- **[docs, MINOR] `docs/features/views.md` Search section is stale**: describes only
  page/tag filter chips; missing the inline filter DSL, the `+ Filter` builder, the
  case/word/regex toggles, regex + filter-only search, per-space history, and mobile
  escalation. Mostly pre-existing; `docs/SEARCH.md` is the current source of truth
  (FEATURE-MAP defers to it), so this is a low-priority focused refresh.
- **[perf/lifecycle, MINOR] `save_all_engines` exit-save has no timeout** (`lib.rs`
  `RunEvent::Exit`): the synchronous `block_on` over the 2-conn writer pool writes a
  multi-MiB snapshot blob per space with no upper bound → shutdown latency grows with
  total snapshot bytes on large multi-space workspaces. Fix: wrap in
  `tokio::time::timeout` + log-skip on expiry (the 5-min periodic task + next-boot
  self-heal cover a missed exit-save). NOT applied overnight: the timeout value must
  be *measured* from real large-workspace save durations (don't invent it), and it's
  on the app-exit path (test exit behavior before changing).
- **[perf, MINOR] periodic snapshot holds the registry mutex across all-space export**
  (`loro/registry.rs` `snapshot_all_engines`): O(spaces × export) under the single
  global engine mutex, so a user typing in space A can stall behind space B's export.
  Fine at the 5-min cadence + human apply rates; the code comment deliberately
  pre-commits to this trade-off. Fix only if multi-space workspaces grow: collect
  engine handles under the lock, drop it, then export. Promote to REVIEW-LATER if
  space counts rise.
- **[DSL enhancement, MINOR] No quoting for `prop:`/`tag:`/`path:` values with spaces**:
  `tokenSource` serializes `prop:key=value` verbatim, so a value containing
  whitespace can't round-trip through the query string (CR8 made `PropFilterForm`
  reject such input rather than corrupt it — a v1 limitation). Proper fix: support
  `prop:key="value with space"` in `serialize.ts` `tokenSource` + `register.ts`
  `parsePropToken` + the tokenizer (the same verbatim-serialize gap pre-exists for
  `tag:`/`path:` values). Then the form can lift the no-space value restriction.

## Stop condition

08:00 CEST 2026-05-24. On stop: `prek run --all-files` green, branch pushed, PR
open against `main` with CI passing, ledger summarized. End the loop.
