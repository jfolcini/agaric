# Install the prek hook toolchain and wire the git hooks.
#
# prek runs the hooks in prek.toml, but it does NOT ship their tools — each
# hook shells out to a binary (local `language = "system"` hooks) or is built
# by prek from a pinned upstream repo (the `gitleaks` / `actionlint` Go hooks
# and the `conventional-pre-commit` Python hook). Without the underlying
# toolchain on the box, the very first `git commit` aborts. This script
# installs that toolchain so a fresh clone — or a fresh dev VM — is
# commit/push-ready, mirroring CI's install set in
# `.github/workflows/_validate.yml` so the local gate matches CI.
#
# Target platforms: Ubuntu 24.04 / 26.04 (primary — apt), other Linux
# (dnf/pacman, best-effort), macOS (brew, best-effort).
#
# Best-effort and idempotent by design:
#   * tools already on PATH are skipped (fast re-runs);
#   * anything that can't be auto-installed on a platform prints a manual hint
#     instead of aborting — a partial toolchain still builds and runs the app,
#     you just can't run every hook until the gap is filled.
# Hence `set -u` but NOT `set -e`: a single failed installer must never sink
# the whole bootstrap (so it is safe to call from `scripts/setup.sh` and from
# VM provisioning).

# cargo-binstall pulls prebuilt release binaries (seconds, low disk) instead
# of the multi-minute from-source `cargo install` compile. Install it from the
# pinned upstream prebuilt release TARBALL — NOT by piping the upstream install
# script into a shell.
#
# Pinned-Dependencies (OpenSSF Scorecard, code-scanning #215): a `curl | bash`
# — or a curl-to-temp-then-`bash` — of the install script is a download-then-run
# that Scorecard flags *regardless of any hash check*, because the static check
# only cares that a downloaded file reaches a shell interpreter. So fetch the
# release *binary* tarball directly (the same `curl … | tar` shape as
# `install_lychee`, which Scorecard accepts) and verify its SHA-256 before
# extracting. The matrix below is Linux-only (where the dev VMs run and where
# the prebuilt speed matters); macOS / other arches fall back to the
# equally-pinned `cargo install --locked` to keep the pinned-hash set small.
